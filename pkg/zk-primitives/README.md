# ZK Primitives

Core zero-knowledge primitives - these provide a common interface for the ZK circuits inputs/outputs, so the circuit backend is abstracted.

## Overview

This package provides the fundamental zero-knowledge cryptographic primitives.

## Features

- UTXO proof circuits
- Digital signature verification
- Merkle path operations
- Note management
- Address utilities
- Aggregation circuits
